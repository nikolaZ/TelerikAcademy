//Write a program that finds how many times a substring is contained in a given text (perform case insensitive search).
//        Example: The target substring is "in". The text is as follows:
//We are living in an yellow submarine. We don't have anything else.
//Inside the submarine is very tight. So we are drinking all the day.
//We will move out of it in 5 days.
//    The result is: 9.
